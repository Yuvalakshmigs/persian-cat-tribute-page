						<h2>History of the Persian Cat</h2>
						<p>
							Surprisingly little is known about the history of the Persian cat, despite its presence among humans since the 1600s. Persians are thought to have originated in Persia, (now modern-day Iran) and Turkey. The breed moved westward to Europe with the Crusades.


							They became popular among the nobility, including Queen Victoria of England. The breed had elegant long hair—a position they shared with other long-haired cats of the region, a group referred to at the time as Asiatic cats. Persians were originally called Angoras, named for Ankara, the capital of Turkey.


							The popularity of Persian cats was further bolstered when the cat show circuit started to gain steam in the late 19th century. It was during this time that they were brought over to the United States, where they quickly surpassed the Maine Coon cat as America’s preferred long-haired cat breed.


							Features of show-worthy Persian cats include round heads, stubby noses, rounded ears, and short bodies. Traditional Persians, sometimes referred to as "doll faces," have a more prominent nose, though they share many of the other physical and temperamental qualities of their pedigreed counterparts.


							Persians are the most registered cat breed by the Cat Fanciers Association and a frequent Best in Show winner. Their celebrated snub noses and chubby cheeks have been selectively bred and exaggerated in the years since the breed gained such widespread human appreciation, though you can still find evidence of Persian’s ancient features in traditional, non-show focused members of the breed.

						<h2>Persian Cat Care</h2>
						<p>Because of their long coats, it should come as no surprise that Persian cats require a good deal of regular grooming. Without it, Persians’ coats can quickly become tangled and matted, which can be painful. It is recommended that Persians be brushed once a day and receive monthly baths to help them maintain their shine and softness.

						Eyes should also be wiped daily to prevent stains from excessive watering. As with all cats, regular dental hygiene should be observed in the form of daily or weekly teeth brushing. Regular nail trims are also required.

						Generally, Persians are considered to be high maintenance pets when it comes to their grooming care. Because their coats don’t naturally shed dirt and other debris, it’s up to their human caregivers to help ensure that they stay soft and clean and to keep them indoors. Persians prefer to be kept in tidy environments, so it’s also important to clean their litter box daily.

						Persians are not the most energetic or playful of cat breeds. A Persian would much rather find a nice warm spot to relax. It can sometimes get an unusual burst of energy, but that is usually followed by a long catnap with relatively no activity.

						This breed is a slower learner and not considered a very trainable cat. It would prefer to watch than participate in activities.</p>

						<h2>Common Health Problems</h2>
						<p>Like all purebred cats, Persians are prone to a number of health issues that are perpetuated by selective breeding tendencies. A lot of these problems are directly related to the preferred facial structure of pedigreed Persians, though they also may present with genetic health problems unrelated to their physical features. It’s important to keep a close eye on Persians so that any concerning health issues are caught and treated early.

						While responsible breeders do take steps to mitigate the spread of common health problems among their litters, no breeder can say with certainty that their cats are completely free of illness or the potential for illness. Common health problems to look out for among Persian cats include:

						Polycystic kidney disease, a genetic illness affecting one or both kidneys that generally starts showing signs when the cat is around 7 to 10 years old
						Breathing difficulties and respiratory distress caused by their snub noses
						Eye conditions, including progressive retinal atrophy, eyelid protrusions (cherry eye), and folding inward eyelids (entropion)
						Excessive eye watering
						Bladder stones and bladder infections
						Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the muscular walls of the heart
						Liver shunts, a disorder affecting blood flow to the liver, which can cause a runty appearance, bladder stones, and anemia
						Heat sensitivity</p>
